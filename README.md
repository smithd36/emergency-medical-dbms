# JavaFX GUI DBMS using MySQL and SQLite

This program is written in Java, using the Maven dependency management system. This program has implementations of bootstrapfx and CSS styling through JavaFX. Created to manage licensure of an institution, this program has been modified for GitHub display and distribution accordingly, excluding any and all critical account information including database login credentials. To view the program in action, check out these shots:

# Database
The database is using Azure to serve users in an efficient way that allows simplicity and fast responses for users. The database is able to stay organized through a login management system built into the code which only allows one user to log in at a time. The "Lockbox" SQLite Database is not included in the files as it contains critical logon information and the DB can be easily reproduced with non-critical login credentials for a user looking to test the program on a different database,

# Functionality
This program can effectively be ran on any device through the implementation of a JLaunch deployment process or a .jar file including all dependencies and required runtime environments and drivers. This program took roughly 2 weeks of my own time to make while simultaneously producing an Email Agent (seen in a different repo) to monitor this same database and notify a set group of people when an employee in the database is a certain amount of days nearing an expiration of a certail license.
